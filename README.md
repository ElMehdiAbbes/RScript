## Expected results ?
For this project we will use publicly available data from LendingClub.com. We will use data from 2007 to 2010 before the company went public. Using the data, we will try to predict whether a borrower has repaid the money or not. We have attached the data as CSV in the share price documentation.

1. Read data.
2. Explorative data analysis of data.
3. Generate some visualizations for a general overview.
4. Prepare data for a random forest classification model.
5. Training a decision tree model
6. Evaluation of data
